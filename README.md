# Mineboard - Minecraft Server Control

## What this is
**Mineboard** is a multi-tenant Flask dashboard that allows each user to connect and control their own Minecraft server over RCON. It wraps common admin tasks (teleport, give items, run kits, quick gamerule toggles, whitelist/op, weather/time, locate villages) behind a web UI and a small REST API.

**Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Each user can configure their own RCON connection to manage their personal Minecraft server. Multiple users can use the same Mineboard instance to manage different servers simultaneously.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before setting up Mineboard, ensure you have:
- A running Minecraft server with RCON enabled
- RCON port accessible from where Mineboard is hosted

**Don't have a Minecraft server?** Check out our [Minecraft Server Setup Guide](minecraft_server/README.md) for a quick Docker-based server deployment.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### ⭐ Recommended: One-Click Installation

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+, wget, and root access

Download and install Mineboard with a single command:

```bash
# Download the installer
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeperfectplus/mineboard/refs/heads/main/deploy-native.sh

# Make it executable and run
chmod +x deploy-native.sh
sudo ./deploy-native.sh --install
```

This will automatically:
- Clone the repository
- Create a dedicated `mineboard` system user
- Set up a Python virtual environment at `/opt/mineboard`
- Install all dependencies
- Configure systemd service for automatic startup
- Start Mineboard on port 5090
- default user: admin / password: admin (change on first login)

**Uninstall:**
```bash
sudo ./deploy-native.sh --uninstall
```

---

### Alternative: Docker Deployment (Development)

**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose installed

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/codeperfectplus/mineboard.git
cd mineboard

# Using Docker Compose
docker compose up -d --build

# Or using the convenience script
bash up.sh
```
---

### After Installation

**Service Management:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start mineboard    # Start the service
sudo systemctl stop mineboard     # Stop the service
sudo systemctl restart mineboard  # Restart the service
sudo systemctl status mineboard   # Check status
sudo journalctl -u mineboard -f   # View logs
```

**Access the Dashboard:**
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5090
```

### Configure Your Server
```
http://localhost:5090
```

### Configure Your Server
1. **Login** with default credentials (if set) or create your first admin user
2. **Go to Settings** page
3. **Configure your RCON connection:**
   - Enter your Minecraft server **Host** (e.g., `172.17.0.1` or `minecraft-server`)
   - Enter your RCON **Port** (default: `25575`)
   - Enter your RCON **Password** (must match your server's `rcon.password`)
4. **Click "Test Connection"** button to verify connectivity
5. **Save Configuration** once the test succeeds

**✅ That's it!** Each user can configure their own server connection in the Settings page.

## 🔧 High-Level Architecture
- **Flask App** - Exposes UI + RESTful JSON endpoints
- **RCON Client** - Maintains persistent connection to each user's Minecraft server
- **SQLite Database** - Stores user accounts and saved locations per user
- **JSON Config Files** - Predefined kits and quick commands
- **Docker Support** - Easy deployment with persistent data at `/app/data`

## 🎮 Setting Up Your Minecraft Server

Need to set up a Minecraft server with RCON enabled? We've got you covered!

👉 **[Minecraft Server Setup Guide](minecraft_server/README.md)** - Complete guide to deploy a Docker-based Minecraft server

**Key Requirements for RCON:**
- `enable-rcon=true` in `server.properties`
- `rcon.port=25575` (or your custom port)
- `rcon.password=your_password` (must match Mineboard settings)

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Multi-Tenant Setup
- Each user logs in and configures their own server connection
- No shared RCON credentials - everyone manages their own server
- Admins can create user accounts via the User Management page

### Testing Connection
- Always use the **"Test Connection"** button in Settings before saving
- If connection fails, verify:
  - Server IP/hostname is correct
  - RCON port is open and accessible
  - RCON password matches your server configuration
  - Firewall allows RCON connections
